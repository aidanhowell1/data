# E‑commerce Sales Data Analysis (R)

This project demonstrates how to explore and visualize a synthetic e‑commerce sales dataset using the R programming language.  The dataset contains 800 orders from the first quarter of 2023 and includes demographic and transactional attributes such as customer age, gender, region, product category, order amount, and payment method.  The data were programmatically generated to resemble realistic e‑commerce transactions, and the focus of this repository is on performing the analysis rather than on the generation process itself.

## Dataset

The file `ecommerce_sales_data.csv` contains 800 rows with the following columns:

* **OrderID** – unique order identifier (e.g., `10001`).
* **OrderDate** – order date between 2023‑01‑01 and 2023‑03‑31.
* **CustomerID** – anonymized customer identifier (e.g., `CUST001`).
* **Gender** – customer gender (`Male`, `Female`, or `Other`).
* **Age** – customer age (18–65).
* **Region** – customer region (`North`, `South`, `East`, or `West`).
* **ProductCategory** – category of the purchased product (`Electronics`, `Clothing`, `Home & Kitchen`, `Books`, or `Sports`).
* **OrderAmount** – transaction amount in U.S. dollars.
* **PaymentMethod** – method of payment (`Credit Card`, `Paypal`, or `Debit Card`).

The dataset is provided with this repository.  No additional data preparation is required before running the analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis is contained in the R Markdown file `ecommerce_data_analysis.Rmd`.  It uses common R packages (`readr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, and `RColorBrewer`) to:

* Load and inspect the dataset.
* Summarize and clean the data (check for missing values, verify data types).
* Visualize sales trends over time.
* Calculate and plot average order amounts by customer region.
* Create a heatmap of total sales by product category and payment method.
* Explore the relationship between customer age and order amount with a scatter plot colored by gender.

Running the R Markdown file will produce an HTML report and will save the charts as image files (PNG format).  The images are included in this repository for reference and can be regenerated by knitting the R Markdown document.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. Make sure you have the necessary R packages installed.  You can install any missing packages with:

   ```R
   install.packages(c("readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "RColorBrewer"))
   ```

2. Open `ecommerce_data_analysis.Rmd` in RStudio or your preferred R IDE.

3. Knit the document to HTML (or run the code chunks individually) to reproduce the analysis and figures.  The resulting plots will be saved automatically in the same folder as the R Markdown file.

## Notes

* The dataset is synthetic and created for demonstration purposes; it does not contain real customer data.
* Random seeds used during data generation ensure that the dataset remains consistent across runs.  If you need to generate a different dataset or adjust its size, you can adapt the data generation process accordingly.
